VERSION CHANGES

1.0.17: (4/14/2000) newt@scyld.com
	* removed archaic index.html
	* removed mft as an included component. The scyld packager
	  now auto-includes this when you ask for bmap. mft will
	  now be maintained and versioned seperately.
	* BUGFIX: casting error created problems on files located above 2gb.
	  to fix this in older copies, look for assignments to 'offset' and
	  cast the first argument as 'long long'

1.0.16: (4/11/2000) newt@scyld.com
	* maintenance release. No useful changes.

1.0.15: (4/03/2000) newt@scyld.com
	* improved SGML documentation

1.0.14: (3/25/2000) newt@scyld.com
	* cleanup patchlevel. Removed stale patches from CVS to reflect
	some new organization.

1.0.13: (3/24/2000) newt@scyld.com
	* released courtesy copy to FBI CART.

1.0.12: (3/22/2000) newt@scyld.com
	* released courtesy copy to DCFL with interim documentation improvements.

1.0.11: (3/15/2000) newt@scyld.com
	* released courtesy copy to State Department.

1.0.10: (3/6/2000) newt@scyld.com
	* man pages are now auto-generated. This is made possible
	  now through additions to the support libraries. 'bmap' and
	  'slacker' will generate man pages when run with '--man'.
	* added a new option flag -- 'MOF_HIDDEN' that allows an option
	  to exist without being displayed in help screens or man pages.
	* added a new mode option to bmap '--mode=checkfrag'. This
	  checks for fragmentation and returns 0 if the file is fragmented.
	* moved bmap option '--mode=fragment' to '--mode=frag'
	* spun the support library functions into the 'mft' directory.
	  (These are the common library routines that various forensic
	   tools share with mcgruff).

1.0.9: (3/5/2000) newt@scyld.com
	* integrated latest option processing code from mcgruff.
	  try 'bmap --help' to see the difference that the new
	  'verbose enum' has made to the readability of the
	  built-in documentation.

1.0.8: (3/4/2000) newt@scyld.com
	* Updated man pages. Built on PowerPC linux.

1.0.7: (3/3/2000) newt@scyld.com
	* 'slacker' added as a companion utility for bmap. This utility
           operates on the collective slack of a directory tree and
	   performs many of the same slack operations as bmap.

1.0.6: (2/28/2000) newt@scyld.com
	* BUGFIX: bmap modes 'wipe','wipeslack','putslack','slackbytes'
	  failed to correctly operate on zero-length files. In certian
	  cases, this tool may attempt to write to block 0 of a raw
	  device. This is very bad.
	* BUGFIX: stat sometimes lies about the number of blocks in the file.
	  bmap no longer trusts these counts.

1.0.5: (2/24/2000) newt@scyld.com
	* improved logging.

1.0.4: (2/24/2000) newt@scyld.com
	* added support for 'raw device' operations in Rick Niles'
	  userspace filesystem shell.

1.0.3: (2/23/2000) newt@scyld.com
	* modified logging code to try to get initial log thresh
	  from environment variable (MCGRUFF_LOG_THRESH).
	* modified option processing code to allow options like
	  '--carve' to be interpreted as '--mode=carve' to supply
	  backwards compatibility

1.0.2: (2/22/2000) newt@scyld.com
	* rearranged invokation slightly. '--carve','--wipe', etc now
	  are invoked as '--mode=carve','--mode=wipe', etc.
	* added 'putslack' mode to write into slack.
	* added 'checkslack' mode to quietly test for slack.

1.0.1: (2/15/2000) newt@scyld.com
	* now maintained by Scyld Computing Corporation
	* added option and logging code from mcgruff

1.0.0: (12/28/1999) newt@hq.nasa.gov
	* promoted version to 1.0.

0.1.10: (12/22/1999) jakers@hq.nasa.gov
	* added 'label' option to print the physical sector information
	  on slack space
	* added 'fragfile' option to print fragmented file info to the 
	  filename specified. Enables a file to be sector mapped and 
	  highlighted if it is fragmented on same pass.
	* added 'name' option to print the name of the current file
	  being bmapped to stdout
	* added 'verbose' option to print status info on execution

0.1.9: (12/2/1999) newt@hq.nasa.gov
	* minor tweaks.

0.1.8: (11/12/1999) newt@hq.nasa.gov
	* bmap can now automatically find the device to slack and
	  carve from.

0.1.7: (11/12/1999) newt@hq.nasa.gov
	* Trailing whitespace in Makefile caused 'make install' to fail.
	* man pages were not being installed. (after all the trouble I went
	  to to write them!)

0.1.6: (9/2/1999) newt@hq.nasa.gov
	* added LICENSE file with copyright, warranty, and license information.

0.1.5: (1/7/1999) newt@hq.nasa.gov
	* added cheesy b2s byte->sector converter because bash only
	  performs shell arithmetic on longs.

0.1.4: (1/7/1999) newt@hq.nasa.gov
	* altered bmap to output sector numbers instead of block numbers

0.1.3: (1/4/1999) newt@hq.nasa.gov
	* built for AlphaLinux
	* built for SparcLinux
	* added '--carve' to bmap to carve out blocks associated with a file.
	* added '--slack' to bmap to carve out trailing data in the terminal
	  block of a file.
	* added '--raw' to bmap to specify name of raw device to read for
	  '--carve' and '--slack'

0.1.2: (1/1/1999) newt@hq.nasa.gov
	* added skeleton for bogoseek() for seeking on large files.
	* modified bmap to use lstat() for statting filenames. This allows
	  us to easily collate the results of several runs without having to
	  uniq blocks double-counted through dereferencing symlinks
	* corrected block count calculation to match observed behavior of
	  ext2fs on the author's machine.
	* added crude hole detection. high-quality hole detection will be
	  difficult.

0.1.1: (12/31/1998) newt@hq.nasa.gov
	* initial release.
